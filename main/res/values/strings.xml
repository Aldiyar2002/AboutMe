    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aldiyar.
\n\nOnce upon a time I was led by a road of adventure, until my parents bought me a computer.
\n\nWith it, I can do a lot of things without getting up from my chair.
\nIt changed my life and I am grateful to my parents and my first computer for being here.
\n\nI remember playing Sonic Heroes, GTA SA, Minecraft for the first time. Unforgettable feelings.
\nJump into haystacks, steal cars, break trees with your hand, be the mafia, be a street racer or build your kingdom. And all this can be done not in real life.
\nAmazing!
\n\nOh, the internet. Years of life can be lost in it. But this is different.
